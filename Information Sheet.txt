Additional comments (including problems and extra credit):

____I included FindWord.java because I copied some code from it, 

but the file is not needed for my programs to run.  I included 

Assig3B.java for extra credit. It allows characters within words 

to change direction. You can test this using sample4.txt, which 

I wrote. It's a grid containing the phrase "the quick brown fox 

jumps over the lazy dog". The phrase winds around the grid. You 

can search for it the same way you search for phrases in 

Assig3.java.___________________________________________________
